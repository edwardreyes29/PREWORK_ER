To clarify, I have made no changes or corrections to the page layout. I was only concerned 
about the functionality of the website which I believe I've successfully addressed. 

In the .html file, there were a few errors I've found.
1. Line: 106 The id's for the text colors did not match with the text that defines the color.

2. Line 131: The script tag's src was "error.js" when it should be "logic.js", so the page
was unable to load the script file onto the page.

3. Line 90: The text within the ordered list tags were not wrapped around <li> tags,
so the text appeared with no numbers to signify their order.

4. The title of the page was missing a h1 tag, which is why it did not appear large and white. I've wrapped
the title of the page with h1 tags.

5. The image link and attributes were not wrapped around with angle brackets. I've added <,/, and > to
complete the <img> element so it could render in the html page properly.

I also found two errors in the logic.js file.
1. The booFacts array was missing several quotation marks, making the array only have one element when
each sentence separated by commas were supposed to be their own element. I've included double quotes
where they were needed.

2. A couple of "click" methods were missing quotes as well. I added quotes to the on-click functions
that were missing them.

I have not found any errors in the style.css file.
